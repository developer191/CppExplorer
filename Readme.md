## CppExplorer

CppExplorer is a file explorer written in C++ using the Qt framework. As of version 1, it has all the key features needed by a file explorer. Version 1 is our first release. Therefore, you will not find it to be overly pratical. This will change very quickly, possibly the time you are reading it. This README will be updated to be more thorough as the program matures. Note: This is currently being developed on Linux; it has not been tested on any other platforms. However, I am designing it to be easily ported to other platforms, so Windows support is planned. Stay tuned!
